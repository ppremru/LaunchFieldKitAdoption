# Launch Field-Kit Adoption

**REORG WORK IN PROGRESS**

**Check back July 30th**

Welcome! This repository serves as the central hub for our Field-Kit Enablement Community of Practice (CoP). Designed to streamline the onboarding experience for new team members, this CoP provides essential resources and guidance for mastering the Field-Kit solution, which is built on a Red Hat Product Stack. Our goal is to equip technicians with the knowledge and tools needed to effectively support and continuously improve the Field-Kit solution.
