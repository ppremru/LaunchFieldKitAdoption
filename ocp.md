### Independent Learning

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

#### Crawl - Pre OCP

Awareness of concepts such as containers, container registries, and ???.  These are useful concepts for profiles in operations and development.

#### Crawl - OCP

Awareness of container orchestration. Focus on foundational concepts, initial access, basic CLI usage, and a simple "Hello World" deployment.  A bit of start-at-the-end approach, use OCP, not focused on installation.

## Tips

The questions below don't always have a quick answer; they often require hands-on experimentation and teamwork to set up and troubleshoot. Refer to the crawl and walk section of recommendations for both ansible and foundations.  Refer to the crawl and walk section of recommendations for both *OCP* and *foundations*.

### Deploy an OCP Cluster

Lean into the user documentation and experiment.

* [Installation overview](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/installation_overview/index)
* [Disconnected Environment](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/disconnected_environments/index)
* [Updating clusters](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/updating_clusters/index)

### Perform advanced maintenance on an OCP Cluster

* Research and experiment with:
  * OCP Operators
  * GitOps Workflows, Helm charts, ArgoCD
