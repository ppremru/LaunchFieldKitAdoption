### Independent Learning

#### Crawl

Awareness of concepts such as containers, container registries, container orchestration, pods, operators -  as well as DevOps and GitOps.
These are useful concepts for profiles in operations and development.

## Tips

The questions below don't always have a quick answer; they often require hands-on experimentation and teamwork to set up and troubleshoot. Refer to the crawl and walk section of recommendations for both ansible and foundations.  Refer to the crawl and walk section of recommendations for both *OCP* and *foundations*.

### Deploy an OCP Cluster

Lean into the user documentation and experiment.

* [Installation overview](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/installation_overview/index)
* [Disconnected Environment](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/disconnected_environments/index)
* [Updating clusters](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/updating_clusters/index)

### Perform advanced maintenance on an OCP Cluster

* Research and experiment with:
  * OCP Operators
  * GitOps Workflows, Helm charts, ArgoCD
