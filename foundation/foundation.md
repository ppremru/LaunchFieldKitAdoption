# Enablement Recommendations for Foundational Topics

## Approach

The enablement goal is to check your foundational skills by walking through the recommendations below  - do you have crawl-walk knowledge of topics such as these:

* Understand concepts such as **IaC** and **DevOps**
* Write **YAML** syntax and use lint to verify
* Setup **VSCode** and integrate with YAML
* Experiment with basic **git** commands and workflow
* Do you have additional topics for the CoP approach - or **tips** to share?  
  * [Git Tips](../tips/tips-git.md)
