# Enablement Recommendations for Foundational Topics

## Checklist

The enablement goal is to check your foundational skills via independent learning  - do you have crawl-walk knowledge of topics such as these:

- [x] Understand concepts such as **IaC** and **DevOps**
- [x] Write **YAML** syntax and use lint to verify
- [x] Setup **VSCode** and integrate with YAML
- [x] Experiment with basic **git** commands and workflow
