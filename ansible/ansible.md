# Enablement Recommendations for Ansible Topics

## Approach

In order to support the Field-Kit, the enablement goal is to write and troubleshoot ansible. To do this - start experimenting with ansible using core RHLS structured courses and independent learning.  Do you have crawl-walk level of these skills:
* Write **Playbooks**, use **Roles**, **Collections**, understand **Modules**
* Develop ansible command line **Troubleshooting** skills 
* Do you have suggestions for the CoP or **tips** to share?
  * [Installing Ansible Core](./tips-ansible-install.md)
  * [Developing and Troubleshooting Playbooks](./tips-ansible-run.md)

> *TODO:  Identify use cases that are in the Field-Kit*
