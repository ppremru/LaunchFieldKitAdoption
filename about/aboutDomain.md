# About Our Domain: Field-Kit

## What is a Field-Kit?

A *Field-Kit*, as used in this document, describes a hardware configuration of servers. These servers are specifically intended to run software applications, whether they are virtualized or containerized, for use by users (operators) in the field.

The development solution for a *Field-Kit* exist in a different repository.  That solution leverages Ansible to install and configure the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).   OCP is configured to support virtualized systems and containerized applications. This Community of Practice (CoP) aims to equip the technical support team with the skills to maintain and enhance this solution.
