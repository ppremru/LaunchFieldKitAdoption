# Our Practice: Enablement Patterns

Acknowledging diverse backgrounds, learning styles, and capabilities, team member enablement should be adaptable. This framework serves as a guide, not a rigid rule set.  Examples of enablement materials:

* Red Hat Learning Subscription (RHLS)
* Red Hat Hands-on Labs (no cost)
* Product Documentation
* Blog Posts
* eBooks
* YouTube

## Enablement Maturity

Given the diverse skills within the team, the adoption and enablement of the technology stack will evolve in a phased approach. Maturity stages include:

1. **Crawl**  
Initial exploration
2. **Walk**  
Initial experimentation, quick wins with product capabilities, domain specific solutions, developing good practices
3. **Run**  
Supporting production environment with troubleshooting, debugging, and minor modifications, developing and sharing good practices
4. *Optimizing*  
Ongoing support of the production environment, encompassing cross-functional domains

## Bringing it all together

Completing structured courses, reading, experimentation and collaboration are essential to mastering the skills of the product stack.   The team needs time to absorb new information, skills, and tools. There's an initial learning phase, followed by a period of practice and refinement to achieve proficiency.  Approach:

1. **Red Hat Learning Subscriptions (RHLS)**  
RHLS courses offer structured, comprehensive Red Hat training with features like hands-on labs, instructor-led videos, and expert support, which are not typically found in no-cost materials.  
2. **Independent Learning**  
No cost materials offer foundational using a variety of media from blogs to videos to hands-on labs.
3. **Hands-on Exploration**  
A sandbox dedicated to development provides team members the freedom to innovate and experiment without consequences.
4. **Collaboration**  
Collaboration fosters peer-to-peer learning by regularly demonstrating experiments, problems, and solutions.
