# Why a CoP Based on Enablement? 

With a *Field-Kit* solution in hand, the project team must provide support and plan for future enhancements. A diverse range of user profiles exists, each with unique enablement requirements. Some users possess expert-level knowledge, while others are novices.  Establishing community-driven knowledge article collections can effectively map out pathways and offer valuable reference recommendations. The CoP maintains a versioned set of living documents that provide recommendations - it will take time to cultivate for the team.

## What is a CoP?

A Community of Practice (**CoP**) is a group of people who "share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly."  [^1]

Three crucial characteristics:

1. **Domain**
The community has an identity defined by a shared domain of interest. Members share a common competence or interest that brings them together.  

2. **Community** 
Members engage in joint activities and discussions, help each other, and share information. They build relationships that enable them to learn from each other.

3. **Practice** 
Members are practitioners who develop a shared repertoire of resources, experiences, stories, tools, and ways of addressing recurring problems â€“ in short, a shared practice. This takes time and sustained interaction.

## More about a CoP

Communities of practice (CoP) can form around various topics, such as project management, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, or, in this case, enablement. A community of practice is a group of people who come together around a shared interest to share knowledge, solve problems, and develop expertise over time. Unlike teams or task forces, which often focus on specific goals and deliverables, a community of practice is about long-term learning, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Community members can come from different departments, roles, or skill levels. Instead of obsessing over achieving immediate results, a good community of practice focuses on learning, sharing best practices, and evolving together.

## Collaboration

Increasing collaboration between profiles increases innovations and reduces opportunities for miscommunication.   Communities of practice encourage members from all roles across all departments to share expertise - reduce organizational silos.
