# About the Community

## What is a CoP?

Communities of practice (CoP) can form around various topics, such as project management, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, or, in this case, enablement. A community of practice is a group of people who come together around a shared interest to share knowledge, solve problems, and develop expertise over time. Unlike teams or task forces, which often focus on specific goals and deliverables, a community of practice is about long-term learning, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Community members can come from different departments, roles, or skill levels. Instead of obsessing over achieving immediate results, a good community of practice focuses on learning, sharing best practices, and evolving together.

## Why do we need this CoP?

With a *Field-Kit* solution in hand, the project team must provide support and plan for future enhancements. A diverse range of user profiles exists, each with unique enablement requirements. Some users possess expert-level knowledge, while others are novices.  Establishing community-driven knowledge article collections can effectively map out pathways and offer valuable reference recommendations. The CoP maintains a versioned set of living documents that provide recommendations - it will take time to cultivate for the team.

## Enablement Material

Acknowledging diverse backgrounds, learning styles, and capabilities, team member enablement should be adaptable. This framework serves as a guide, not a rigid rule set.  Examples of enablement materials:

* Red Hat Learning Subscription (RHLS)
* Red Hat Hands-on Labs (no cost)
* Product Documentation
* Blog Posts
* eBooks
* YouTube

## User Profiles

The user profiles identified for the team include:

1. **Infrastructure Developers**
2. **Integrators**  
3. **Software Developers**
4. **Field Operators**

*NOTE: A possible topic to address in the future is to develop a RACI chart specific to these roles.*

### Enablement Maturity

Given the diverse skills within the team, the adoption and enablement of the technology stack will evolve in a phased approach. Maturity stages include:

1. **Crawl**  
Initial exploration
2. **Walk**  
Initial experimentation, quick wins with product capabilities, domain specific solutions, developing good practices
3. **Run**  
Supporting production environment with troubleshooting, debugging, and minor modifications, developing and sharing good practices
4. *Optimizing*  
Ongoing support of the production environment, encompassing cross-functional domains

### Bringing it all together

Completing structured courses, reading, experimentation and collaboration are essential to mastering the skills of the product stack.   The team needs time to absorb new information, skills, and tools. There's an initial learning phase, followed by a period of practice and refinement to achieve proficiency.  Approach:

1. **Red Hat Learning Subscriptions (RHLS)**  
RHLS courses offer structured, comprehensive Red Hat training with features like hands-on labs, instructor-led videos, and expert support, which are not typically found in no-cost materials.  
2. **Independent Learning**  
No cost materials offer foundational using a variety of media from blogs to videos to hands-on labs.
3. **Hands-on Exploration**  
A sandbox dedicated to development provides team members the freedom to innovate and experiment without consequences.
4. **Collaboration**  
Collaboration fosters peer-to-peer learning by regularly demonstrating experiments, problems, and solutions.
